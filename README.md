My name is Zeshan (pronounced "zee-shawn").

- I'm studying CS @ UWO's Computer Science program as an undergraduate student currently pursuing an Honours Specialization.
- I am an aspiring full-stack developer in pursuit of becoming a more proficient developer in various front-end and back-end technologies. I'm also working towards becoming a better programmer for analysis of difficult algorithms.
